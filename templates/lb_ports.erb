Feature: nmap attacks for <%= @host %> and to use this for your tests, change the value in the profile
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name           | value        |
      | hostname       | <%= @hostname %> |
      | host           | <%= @hostname %> |
      | tcp_ping_ports | 22,25,80,443 |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap-fast attack step
    When I launch a "nmap-fast" attack
    Then the output should match /80.tcp\s+open/

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      80/tcp\s+open
      """

  Scenario: Verify that there are no unexpected ports open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      22/tcp
      25/tcp
      443/tcp
      """
