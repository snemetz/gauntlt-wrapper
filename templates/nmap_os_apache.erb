Feature: Service detection. Make sure Apache is running and does not display the version

  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name     | value            |
      <% config.each do |name, value| -%>
      | <%= name %> | <%= value %> |
      <% end -%>

  Scenario: Detect OS
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -sV -p T:<port_open> -PN <hostname>
      """
    # Verify Apache server with no version info
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      Apache
      """
    But the output should not match:
      """
      Apache httpd [0-9.]+
      """
