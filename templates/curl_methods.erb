Feature: Evaluate responses to various HTTP methods.

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name     | value      |
    <% config.each do |name, value| -%>
    | <%= name %> | <%= value %> |
    <% end -%>

Scenario Outline: Verify server responds correctly to various HTTP methods
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl -1 -k -i -X <method> <curl_options> https://<hostname>
    """
  Then the output should contain "<response>"
  Examples:
    | method | response                       |
    | DELETE | 405 Method Not Allowed |
    | PATCH  | 405 Method Not Allowed |
    | TRACE  | 405 Method Not Allowed |
    | TRACK  | 405 Method Not Allowed |
    | BOGUS  | 405 Method Not Allowed |
