Feature: nmap attacks for <%= config[:host] %> to verify correct port is open and others are not
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name        | value        |
<% config.each do |name, value| -%>
      | <%= name %> | <%= value %> |
<% end -%>

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports and not on other common ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p T:<port_range> -PN <hostname>
      """
    # Verify expected port is open
    Then the output should match /<%= config[:port_open] %>.tcp\s+open/
    # Verify that there are no unexpected ports open
    # TODO: Handle case where good port is first in list
    But the output should not match:
    """
<% first = config[:port_range].split(",").first
   config[:port_range].split(",").each do |port|
     if "#{port}" == "#{config[:port_open]}" then next end
     if first != port then pre = '|' else pre = '' end
-%>
<%= pre %><%= port %>/tcp\s+open<% end %>
    """
