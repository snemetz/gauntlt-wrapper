Feature: nmap attacks for <%= config[:host] %> and to use this for your tests, change the value in the profile
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name           | value        |
      | tcp_ping_ports | 22,25,3306 |
      <% config.each do |name, value| -%>
      | <%= name %> | <%= value %> |
      <% end -%>

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F -Pn <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      3306/tcp
      """

  Scenario: Verify that there are no unexpected ports open
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      25/tcp
      """
