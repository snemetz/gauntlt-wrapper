Feature: Run dirb scan on a URL

Scenario: Use dirb to scan a website for basic security requirements and the DIRB_WORDLISTS environment variable must be set in your path.  You can use different wordlists by changing the environment variable.
  Given "dirb" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name                | value                          |
    | dirb_wordlists_path | Overwritten by $DIRB_WORDLISTS |
    | wordlist            | vulns/tests.txt                |
    <% config.each do |name, value| -%>
    | <%= name %> | <%= value %> |
    <% end -%>

  When I launch a "dirb" attack with:
  """
  dirb https://<hostname> <dirb_wordlists_path>/<wordlist> -f <dirb_options>
  """
  Then the output should contain:
  """
  FOUND: 0
  """
  But the output should not contain:
  """
  FATAL: Too many errors
  """
